# Tivoli Blender Tools

## Installation

No compiled releases exist yet so you have to do it manually.

-   ```bash
    python download_libs.py
    ```

-   Then load the repo dir as addon in Blender using a symbolic link.

## Developing

I recommend you use this extension for developing on VSCode:
